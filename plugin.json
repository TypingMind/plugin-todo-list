    "description": "Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current research session. This helps track progress, organize complex investigations, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step research (3+ distinct phases)\n2. Non-trivial investigations requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests research todo list\n4. User provides multiple research topics (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new research instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing research phases - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new research areas - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward questions\n2. Trivial lookups with no organizational benefit\n3. Research completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/clarification requests\n5. Don't add a task to verify findings unless asked, or you'll overfocus on validation\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Research the impact of climate change on Arctic wildlife\n  Assistant: *Creates todo list:*\n  1. Analyze temperature trends in Arctic regions\n  2. Identify key Arctic species and habitats\n  3. Review scientific studies on wildlife impacts\n  4. Synthesize findings and correlations\n<reasoning>\n  Multi-phase research with dependencies requiring systematic investigation.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Compare healthcare systems across Nordic countries\n  Assistant: *Creates todo list with specific items for each country's system, funding models, outcomes, and comparative analysis*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Complex comparative research requiring systematic tracking across multiple systems.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Investigate renewable energy adoption, economic impacts, policy frameworks, and future projections.\n  Assistant: *Creates todo list breaking down each research area into specific investigation tasks*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Multiple complex research areas provided as list requiring organized investigation management.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Research why my company's market share is declining - analyze competitors, market trends, customer feedback.\n  Assistant: *Creates todo list: 1) Competitor analysis, 2) Market trend research, 3) Customer sentiment analysis, 4) Internal factor review, 5) Strategic recommendations*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Business analysis requires multiple research phases across different data sources.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\n  User: What's the capital of France?\n  Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n<reasoning>\n  Single trivial factual lookup completed in one step.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Explain what photosynthesis is.\n  Assistant: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy...\n\n<reasoning>\n  Informational request with no complex research investigation needed.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Find the current stock price of Apple.\n  Assistant: *Looks up current AAPL price* Apple (AAPL) is currently trading at...\n\n<reasoning>\n  Single straightforward data lookup with immediate results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: What does GDP stand for?\n  Assistant: GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product...\n\n<reasoning>\n  Simple definition request with no multi-step research required.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Task States and Management\n\n1. **Research States:**\n  - pending: Not yet started\n  - in_progress: Currently investigating\n  - completed: Research finished successfully\n  - cancelled: No longer needed\n\n2. **Research Management:**\n  - Update status in real-time\n  - Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing each phase\n  - Only ONE research area in_progress at a time\n  - Complete current investigations before starting new ones\n\n3. **Research Breakdown:**\n  - Create specific, actionable investigation items\n  - Break complex research into manageable phases\n  - Use clear, descriptive research objectives\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Proactive research management demonstrates thoroughness and ensures complete investigation of requirements."
